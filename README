FreeBSD-ia32 intro for Assembly 2018 64k intro compo. Requires at least
OpenGL 4.3, so unless AMD and Intel have significantly stepped up their
driver game, it's NVidia-only on FreeBSD as usual. Ports for other
platforms are available.

32k target failed, so I guess it's a 40k then.

Greets in the intro.
